## Introduction

At the nexus between critical administrative theory, the rigor of Law, and data engineering, we design solutions for high-complexity environments. Our professional practice is based on the deconstruction of managerialist models in favor of evidence-based governance and fiduciary security. We work on the articulation of institutional intelligence and cutting-edge technology to ensure the integrity of transactions and regulatory predictability.

## Action and Research Vectors:

**RIG-AI**: Predictive legislative intelligence using Machine Learning models for monitoring institutional and governmental risks.

**SafeTrade Escrow**: Fiduciary and technical custody architecture via Blockchain, ensuring compliance with contractual milestones in technological and real estate assets.

**Critical Audit**: Diagnosis of strategic legitimacy and governance for organizations in the public sphere and public-private partnerships.
